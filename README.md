## Project 2- Responsive website rationale 
 
The brief for this project was to create a responsive website to increase public awareness about the significance of Robin Boyd’s Churchill House. 

As the target audience was rather broad, I wanted to keep the design relatively simple, sleek and easy to use, but with some modern elements to prevent the webpage from looking too outdated.  

To achieve this, the colour scheme consisted of neutral colours such as black, white and gray. These colours are often associated with simplicity, elegance and modernity (Chapman, 2010), while light blue was included to break up the neutrals to prevent the website from feeling too “stiff” or boring. 

The hero content (banner) adds to the modern feel while also showcasing the main focus of the website in an instant and eye-catching way (Farleigh, 2018). 

To keep the site easy to use for a wide range of visitors, I included navigation both at the top and at the bottom to prevent users the need to scroll to the top. I chose to remove the banner from the content pages as it had already served its purpose on the home page, and would prevent visitors from immediately seeing the content they had navigated to. 

The website uses Helvetica as body text as it is easy to read (Rello & Baeza-Yates, n.d), with a line-height of 1.6 and 16px size for good readability (Schwarz, 2019).  


## Project 2- Responsive website reflection 

In my original design I had included a small image gallery at the beginning of the content pages. As I was not able to create the gallery I originally had in mind without JavaScript, I compromised by adding the images at the bottom of the page and allowing visitors to click the images to view their original size.  
 
I encountered many issues when creating this website, all of which I managed to solve through experimentation and Googling. However, the biggest issue was probably myself. 
 
When creating the website, I realized I would often get too ahead of myself and, as an example, start new pages before I had finalized the template. This would cause me more work down the line as I would then have to add new elements to each and every page, instead of simply copying a finalized template. There were quite a few instances where my priorities did not result in the most effective work flow.  
 
If I were to do this again, I would want to make the content more visually engaging through typography and text-layout, as that is something I struggled with. I looked at websites with a lot of good tips and information on how to make content fun, but ultimately still struggled with incorporating it into this type content. A successful incorporation would have drastically improved the final outcome.  

Below is a snapshot showing my initial design, and the final result.
